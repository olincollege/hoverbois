"A detailed description of your mechanical design (CAD images/renderings are appropriate) and any necessary analysis."

# Summary
Every aspect of the mechanical design of the *Waterstrider* is centered around the principles of light weight, water resiliance, and flotation. The main chassis is CNC machined from a block of foam to be light and give positive flotation in the case of a loss of power on the water. The lift motor is mounted in a duct in the center of the chassis via a plywood plate and 3mm machine screws. The thrust motor and rudders are mounted to a plywood unit at the stern of the hovercraft. As a safety measure against capsizing, auxiliary outriggers are mounted on the port and starboard sides of the *Waterstrider* via plywood legs. These outriggers do not touch the surface of the water in normal operation, but instead will only make contact with the water when the heel angle exceeds safe margins. All electronics except for the motors are housed in a waterproof enclosure mounted into the forward deck of the hovercraft to keep sensitive systems safe from the aquatic environment.

# Chassis
The foam chassis is the core of the design of the *Waterstrider*. The current design leverages CNC technology to create a precise, bouyant, and light structure. The chassis is designed to be CNC machined from a single peice of 2" thick foam, which creates a light, positively bouyant, structure

All above-deck mechanical subsystems are mounted into wells in the foam for robust, positive retainment. The below-deck air system is bonded to the bottom of the foam with flexible, fast-setting glue.
