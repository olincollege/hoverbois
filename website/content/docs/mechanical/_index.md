"A detailed description of your mechanical design (CAD images/renderings are appropriate) and any necessary analysis."

# Summary
Every aspect of the mechanical design of the *Waterstrider* is centered around the principles of light weight, water resiliance, and flotation. The main chassis is CNC machined from a block of foam to be light and give positive flotation in the case of a loss of power on the water. The lift motor is mounted in a duct in the center of the chassis via a plywood plate and 3mm machine screws. The thrust motor and rudders are mounted to a plywood unit at the stern of the hovercraft. As a safety measure against capsizing, auxiliary outriggers are mounted on the port and starboard sides of the *Waterstrider* via plywood legs. These outriggers do not touch the surface of the water in normal operation, but instead will only make contact with the water when the heel angle exceeds safe margins. All electronics except for the motors are housed in a waterproof enclosure mounted into the forward deck of the hovercraft to keep sensitive systems safe from the aquatic environment.

# Chassis
The foam chassis is the core of the design of the *Waterstrider*. The current design leverages CNC technology to create a precise, bouyant, and light structure. The chassis is designed to be CNC machined from a single peice of 2" thick foam, which creates a light, positively bouyant, structure. All above-deck mechanical subsystems are mounted into wells in the foam for robust, positive retainment. The below-deck air system is bonded to the bottom of the foam with flexible, fast-setting glue. The skirt is bonded to the chassis with clear tape.

# Hover design
For maximum hover performance, the *Waterstrideer* utilizes a closed plenum design with a compliant skirt. The closed plenum design increases the hover perfomance for significantly less power draw compared to an open plenum design due to the momentum curtain theory, and the compliant skirt maintains the cusion of air over irregular surfaces like grass and gravel. The source of air movement is a lift fan mounted in a duct in the chassis.

In a closed plenum hovercraft, air is directed downward through the lift fan and hits the plenum, which redirects the air sideways to inflate the skirt. The air can only exit the plenum via the skirt and through carefully located releif holes in the edges of the plenum. To acheive this, we created a box with plywood sides and a Coroplast bottom. The top of the box is bonded to the bottom of the foam chassis, and the bottom of the box acts as the plenum. Holes in the sides of this box allow air to inflate the skirt, and carefully located holes in the plenum ensure that escaping air is directed inside the momentum curtain.

The skirt is made from **___[Joseph's plastic]**. This choice of material is light, waterproof, durable, and flexible. The lift motor is mounted into the duct via a plywood plate that is inset and bonded into the foam chassis.
