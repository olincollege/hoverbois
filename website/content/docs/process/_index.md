# Evolution

{{<img "/images/Pie_Evolution.jpg" "Prototypes side by side in order of progress">}}

Over the course of this project, we used an agile development framework to iteratively design our vehicle. Using the SCRUM method, we split the project up into three "Sprints," with increasing fidelity towards our final goal. At the start of this process, we identified technical risks that the project as a whole faced, and we targeted our sprints to elliminate these risk factors in stages. 

The factors we identified included:
- Rudder mechanical design and software control
- Low-friction vehicle control
- Hover ability
- Aquatic environmental factors

# Sprint 1

**Our goal for Sprint 1 was to create a fan powered kart that was controlled via a rudder.** We knew that in order to accomplish this, we would need to gain familiarity with the electrical system for fan-powered vehicles, estabilsh our software architecture to control a low-friction vehicle via rudder, and develop a workflow to collboratively CAD and manufacture an air propelled vehicle. 

**Mechancial Progress** from this sprint included developing a workflow to collaboratively design and manufacture a chassis for fan powered vehicle, design and fabricate a rudder steering system, and create hardware that integrates with the electrical propulsion system. Mechanical lessons we learned from this sprint included the importance of a more authoritative rudder for control, and the importance of planning how to distribute electical hardware about the vehicle's center of gravity.

**Electrical Progress** from this sprint included gaining familiarity with the drivers and motor controller, and speccing and ordering the high-performance electrical components of the final propusion system for use in Sprint 2 and Sprint 3. Lessons learned from this sprint in the electrical domain included **[WHAT DID WE LEARN?]**

**Software Progress** From this sprint included creating the website backend for controlling the vehicle over wifi, implementing a Discord bot to communicate the IP address for autostarting, and creating the framework of having two onboard micro-computers: a Raspberri Pi and a Pi Pico. The Pi runs the high level software, and the Pico runs the low level motor controll. Software lessons learned from this sprint included **[WHAT DID WE LEARN?]**

**Primary Outcome** of this sprint was that we eliminated fan propulsion and rudder control as complete unknowns. By applying the lessons from this sprint to our next sprint, we were able to make improvements to existing systems based on experience and introduce the element of hover without simultaneous risk factors. In addition to overcoming technical challenges, our team used this sprint to hone our soft skills and establish practices for how best to work with each other for the rest of the semester. One of the outcomes of these discussions was to estabilsh a rotating Project Manage position for the next two sprints.

# Sprint 2

**Our goal for Sprint 2 was to creat a remote controlled terrestrial hovercraft with inertial PID correction for straight-line autonomy.** We knew that in order to accomplish this, we would need to implement the high-performance electrical propulsion system we ordered during Sprint 1, develop software to correct for inherant instbility based on inertial sensor input, and create a hover system and chassis that matched weight with power and could sustain hover.

**Mechanical Progress** from this sprint included creating a lightweight hovercraft chassis and an efficient hover lift system. The implemented system was able to sustain hover for long periods and at high speeds. To accopmlish this, we selected a closed plenum design and made the descision to machine the chassis from lightweight foam.
