# Project Summary

Our goal was to build a semi-autonomous, amphibious hovercraft around the theme
that it could be used for search and rescue missions. We worked towards this
goal using the agile SCRUM process with three 2-week design sprints. We
ultimately ended up building the *Waterstrider*, a remote controlled hovercraft
capable of both terrestrial and aquatic travel.
